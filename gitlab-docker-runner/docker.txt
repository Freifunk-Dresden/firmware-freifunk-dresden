# There are two possibilities to install gitlab-runner
#  1. install native gitlab-runner tools, which runs on host and
#      uses gitlab-runner/helber to build firmware with docker image.
#      This allows to create openwrt-docker-build with bind-mounted
#      /mycache directory. /mycache would then hold working dir and dl dir
#  2. install gitlab-runner as docker image, that has gitlab-runner tools
#      in container. this container runs always to speak with gitlab server.
#      The runners config is within the container.


# https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/docker.html
#
# bind mount to /etc/gitlab-runner/ does not work, so I have to use the
# original docker command to create container.

# for instance set "pull_policy = if-not-present

# create and run container (variante 2)

docker run -d --name gitlab-runner --restart always \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v gitlab-runner-config:/etc/gitlab-runner \
    gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
    
    
# register docker runner with gitlab
# https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/#docker
#
# When ask for default docker image, use "registry.gitlab.freifunk-dresden.de/openwrt-docker-build:latest"
# Registration process will update /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml (which is either
# on host (variante 1) or within the docker-runner container (variante 2)

docker run --rm -it -v gitlab-runner-config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest register

# modify docker configuration and restart container.

docker exec -it gitlab-runner bash

# - add to [runners.docker] to allow loading images when those are not present on any server 
#                           (only generated locally)
#                           but .gitlab-ci.yml has a reference to a remote docker registry
#  pull_policy = ["if-not-present"]
# - restart container (if gitlab-runner was installed as container), or call `gitlab-runner restart` to
#   reload configuration

# Howto use /mycache:
# 1. add /mycache bind mount. this is working because runner creates the openwrt-container within
#    host, not within docker (not nested)
#  volumes = ["/cache", "/root/mycache:/mycache"]
#
# 2. host: mkdir /root/mycache && chmod 777 /root/mycache
#    This is needed because gitlab-runner bind-mounts this directory. firmware is build as user "builder"
#    which is required not to be "root". It has to be able to create /mycache/dl and /mycache/workdir.
#
# 3. Optional if testing manually.
#    - docker run --rm -it -v "/root/mycache:/mycache" freifunkdresden/openwrt-docker-build bash
#      OR docker run --rm -it -v "/mycache:/mycache" freifunkdresden/openwrt-docker-build bash
#    - checkout project `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone https://gitlab.freifunk-dresden.de/firmware-developer/firmware.git`
#    - cd firmware
#    - run the commands in gitlab-ci/docker.yml
