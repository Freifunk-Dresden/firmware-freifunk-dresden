# This file lists one target in each line that should be built
# in one run.
#
#   The order is important for device specific builds.
#   In this case output directory is not deleted and device specific
#   files are placed in exisiting directory.
#
#       Example for device specific:
#               ramips.mt7621.ubiquiti-edgerouter-x
#
#   If no specific device builds are created, then platform directory
#   is deleted before.
#   So consider order when specifying targets!
#
#   Excample:
#   	ramips.mt7621
#	ramips.mt7621.ubiquiti-edgerouter-x"
#   This would first build all targets that can be built, and then device specific
#   builds are generated and copied
#
# target name has specific format:
#   platform.subplatform
# or
#   platform.subplatform.device
